Here's a classic quote from [RL Moore](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Lee_Moore):

> That student is taught the best who is told the least.

During his talk yesterday at the [RL Moore Conference](http://legacyrlmoore.org/events.html), [David Clark](http://www.researchgate.net/profile/David_Clark18) provided a slight modification:

> The student is taught the best who is told only enough to ensure that he or she will continue to work hard, stay engaged, and make progress.

I think David's revision does an excellent job of capturing the experience I hope to provide the students in my [inquiry-based learning](http://maamathedmatters.blogspot.com/2013/05/what-heck-is-ibl.html) (IBL) classes with.
