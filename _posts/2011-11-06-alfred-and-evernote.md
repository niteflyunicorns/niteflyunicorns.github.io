I'm a big fan of using the Mac productivity tool [Alfred][1] and I use [Evernote][2] to store all sorts of snippets of information. Alfred is free, but if you purchase the [Power Pack][3], you gain the ability to add custom scripts via Alfred extensions. While browsing the [extension gallery][4], I stumbled on the [Evernote extension][5] by [Kristian Hellquist][6] that allows you to use Alfred to create a note in Evernote with the subject and tags that you specify. However, using the default script, you cannot add content to your note via Alfred and Evernote does not come to the front.

Typically, when I want to create a new note in Evernote, I have something specific that I want to make a note about, and it seemed that having to then click on the note you just created in Evernote to add content defeated the purpose of using Alfred. Within a few hours of asking about this, Kristian was kind enough to create a new script that brings the note you just created to the front for you to add content to. To use this alternate script, copy Kristian's gist found [here][7] and then update the original Evernote script by going to the Extensions tab of Alfred's preferences.
