I love the following quote by French mathematician Henri Poincaré (1854-1912).  I'm not sure what the original source is, but it is cited in the introduction to *The Divine Proportion* (1970) by H.E. Huntley.

<blockquote>
<p>The mathematician does not study pure mathematics because it is useful; he studies it because he delights in it, and he delights in it because it is beautiful.</p>
