When I was preparing [my talk][1] for the [Legacy of R.L. Moore Conference][2] a couple weeks ago, I reread the student evaluations for my [introduction to proof course][3] from Spring 2013. I was really pleased with all the comments, but two of them stood out because they capture the essence of what I want an [inquiry-based learning][4] (IBL) experience to be.

Here's the first comment.

> [...] he has found the perfect way to teach this course. [...] The way Professor Ernst had us struggle through homework and then come together as a group and discuss the topics was very beneficial. I personally struggled through most of the material and when I finally got to the right concept I felt like I fully understood it because I personally came to that conclusion. Also, when I didnâ€™t fully understand a topic, coming together and discussing it connected all the gaps I was missing. [...] As a future educator, I would love to mimic his style of teaching so I can share with my students the same satisfaction that I got out of this style of teaching.

I stripped out a couple complimentary sentences that addressed me rather than the course. Of course, I'm thrilled about this student's desire to incorporate IBL in their future teaching, but what I really appreciate about this comment is how the student reflects on both his/her independence and collaboration.

Here is the second, very short comment.

> Try, fail, understand, win.

Four words of awesomeness. I couldn't hope for more. This second comment inspired a [recent post][5] that [Angie Hodge][6] and I recently wrote for [Math Ed Matters][7].
