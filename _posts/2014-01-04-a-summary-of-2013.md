Here's a quick run down on the annual stats for my blog according to [Jetpack](http://jetpack.me/). For the complete report, go [here](http://jetpack.me/annual-report/31858472/2013/).

This blog was viewed about 16,000 times in 2013. My [teaching page]({{ site.baseurl }}/teaching/) is a subdomain of my main site, so I'm guessing that a good chunk of that 16,000 is a result of my students clicking around (but I'm not sure about that). In 2013, there were 29 new posts, growing the total archive of this blog to 63 posts.

The busiest day of the year was September 18th with 340 views. The most popular post that day was [Free and Open-Source Textbooks]({{ site.baseurl }}/resources/free-and-open-source-textbooks/).

The top five most viewed posts in 2013 were:

  1. [LaTeX Homework Template]({{ site.baseurl }}/latex-homework-template/), Aug 2012
  2. [Mathematics Education on the arXiv?]({{ site.baseurl }}/mathematics-education-on-the-arxiv/), Jul 2013
  3. [Montessori Observations]({{ site.baseurl }}/montessori-observations/), Apr 2013
  4. [An infinite non-cyclic group whose proper subgroups are cyclic]({{ site.baseurl }}/an-infinite-non-cyclic-group-whose-proper-subgroups-are-cyclic/), Dec 2013
  5. [Euler's Research Rules]({{ site.baseurl }}/eulers-research-rules/), Oct 2013

The top referring sites in 2013 were:

  1. [Twitter](http://twitter.com)
  2. [Google+](http://plus.google.com)
  3. [Facebook](http://facebook.com)
  4. [My Teaching Page]({{ site.baseurl }}/teaching/)
  5. [Booles' Rings](http://boolesrings.org)

I would have expected Google+ to be the top referrer and I'm a bit surprised that Facebook made the list at all. I'm happy to see that being a part of Booles' Rings (a network of academic home pages/blogs) is bringing some traffic this way and I hope that I'm reciprocating at least a little.

Visitors came from 114 different countries! Most visitors came from the United States, but Canada and the United Kingdom were not far behind.

The most commented on post in 2013 was [Mathematics Education on the arXiv?][6] with 26 comments. These were the 5 most active commenters on this blog:

  1. [Dana Ernst]({{ site.baseurl }}), 26 Comments
  2. [François G. Dorais](http://dorais.org/), 7 Comments
  3. [Bret Benesh](http://symmetricblog.wordpress.com/), 4 Comments
  4. Simon H., 3 Comments
  5. [Peter Krautzberger](http://boolesrings.org/krautzberger/), 2 Comments

I guess it's no surprise that I was the top commenter. It is worth pointing out that François and Peter are also members of [Booles' Rings](http://boolesrings.org).

Thanks for a fun year!
