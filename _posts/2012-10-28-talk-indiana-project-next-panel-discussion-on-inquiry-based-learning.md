Yesterday, I was part of a panel discussion about inquiry-based learning (IBL) at the Fall 2012 [Indiana MAA Section Meeting][1]. The other panelists included [Robert Talbert][2] (Grand Valley State University) and [Mindi Capaldi][3] (Valparaiso University). The panel was organized by the [Indiana Section NExT][4], which is the Indiana version of the national [Project NExT][5]. Here is the abstract for the session:

> We will discuss inquiry based learning, inverted classroom models, peer instruction, and other alternatives to lecture-based instruction. Panelists will give a brief intro of their experience in these areas, followed by an extended time of Q&A with the audience. This panel is open to all meeting participants.

You might be wondering how I ended up at the Indiana MAA Section Meeting. One of my Project NExT fellows, [Lara Pudwell][6] (Valparaiso University), sent me a message several weeks ago asking if I knew anyone near Indiana that would be interested in speaking on a panel about inquiry-based learning. I told her that I wasn't anywhere near Indiana, but that I would love to be a part of the panel. Since I'm not swimming in travel money, I contacted [Stan Yoshinobu][7] (Cal Poly and Director of the [Academy of Inquiry Based Learning][8]) to see if the [Visiting Speakers Bureau][9] might be able to pay my way. Thankfully, my request for travel funding was approved. Woot! I'd like to thank AIBL and the [Educational Advancement Foundation][10] for funding these sorts of things.

The panel discussion was well-attended and it seemed to go very well. Each of the three panelist spoke for about 5-10 minutes and then the floor was opened to questions. The questions (during the session and later at lunch) covered a variety of topics, but as expected, people were interested in how to implement IBL in large classes and/or courses where coverage of a significant amount of content is a requirement. In my opinion, these are two of the biggest obstacles to adopting all sorts of effective and progressive teaching approaches. The obstacles are not insurmountable, but modifications (and compromises) of how I might run my upper-level proof-based classes must be made. I'll try to write a post that addresses some potential strategies for dealing with large classes and the coverage issue.

Here are the slides for my portion of the panel discussion.
