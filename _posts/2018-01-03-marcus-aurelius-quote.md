I recently listened to [Episode 64](http://www.powercompanyclimbing.com/blog/2017/11/6/episode-64-fixed-vs-growth-mindset-with-trevor-ragan-from-trainugly) of [The Power Company Podcast](http://www.powercompanyclimbing.com/podcast/). In this episode, the host interviews [Trevor Ragan](http://trainugly.com/trevor-ragan/) from [TrainUgly](http://trainugly.com) and the topic of discussion is fixed versus growth mindset. For an introduction to growth mindset, a good place to start is the post I wrote for the [Teaching Tidbits Blog](http://maateachingtidbits.blogspot.com) called [The Role of Failure and Struggle in the Mathematics Classroom](http://maateachingtidbits.blogspot.com/2017/11/the-role-of-failure-and-struggle-in.html). At the end of the podcast, Ragan suggests some further reading.  One of those books is [The Obstacle is the Way: The Timeless Art of Turning Trials into Triumph](https://www.amazon.com/Obstacle-Way-Timeless-Turning-Triumph/dp/1591846358) by Ryan Holiday, which I recently started reading.  The beginning of this book contains the following quote by Roman emperor [Marcus Aurelius](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marcus_Aurelius) that embraces obstacles and discourages the fear of failure:

<blockquote>
<p>The impediment to action advances action. What stands in the way becomes the way.</p>
