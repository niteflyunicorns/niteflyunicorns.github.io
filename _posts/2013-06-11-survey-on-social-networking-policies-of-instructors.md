Dear College Instructors,

[Matthew Leingang][1] (NYU), [Ron Taylor][2] (Berry College), and I are interested in how college instructors utilize social media. In particular, we are curious how teachers interact with their current and past students on social networks like Facebook and Google+. How do you interact with your current and former students on social media? Do you have policies about this interaction? We have put together a short survey to gather some data regarding this often sensitive issue. The intent is to summarize the results in a short article that will likely be submitted to [MAA FOCUS][3]. We would be thrilled if you would take a few minutes to complete [our short survey][4].

Thanks!

Dana, Matthew, & Ron
