The Jedi Master [Yoda](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yoda) has had some [awesome quotes](http://awakenthegreatnesswithin.com/40-inspirational-yoda-quotes-to-awaken-the-force-within-you/) over the years.  The quote below from [The Last Jedi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_Wars:_The_Last_Jedi) is one of my all-time favorites from Yoda because it embraces productive failure.

<blockquote>
<p>Pass on what you have learned. Strength, mastery. But weakness, folly, failure also. Yes, failure most of all. The greatest teacher, failure is.</p>
