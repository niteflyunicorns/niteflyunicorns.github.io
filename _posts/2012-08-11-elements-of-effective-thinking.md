I highly recommend watching this video of Professor [Michael Starbird][1] (University of Texas) presenting his insights into the philosophy of teaching at the [Mathematical Association of America PREP Workshop][2] called "Using Inquiry Based Learning in Second-Year Calculus and Courses for Prospective Teachers", which took place at UC Santa Barbara, June 2012.
