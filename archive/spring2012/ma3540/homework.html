<h2>Getting Help</h2>
<p>There are many resources available to get help.  First, I recommend that you work on homework in groups as much as possible, and to come see me whenever necessary.  Also, you are strongly encouraged to ask questions in the <a href="http://www.plymouth.edu/webapp/courses/course/view.php?id=15986" target="_blank">course forum</a> on our Moodle page page, as I will post comments there for all to benefit from.  To effectively post to the course forum, you will need to learn the basics of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LaTeX" target="_blank">LaTeX</a>, the standard language for typesetting in the mathematics community.  See the <a href="../../latex.html">Quick LaTeX guide</a> for help with $\LaTeX$.  If you need additional help with $\LaTeX$, post a question in the <a href="http://www.plymouth.edu/webapp/courses/course/view.php?id=15986" target="_blank">course forum</a> on our Moodle page.</p>

<p>You can also visit the <a href="http://www.plymouth.edu/math/resources/center.html" target="_blank">Math Activity Center</a>, which is located in Hyde 351.  This student-run organization provides peer tutoring services for most 1000 and 2000 level math courses and some 3000 level courses.  Tutors are typically math majors interested in teaching math and practicing their instructional skills.  You can drop in anytime during open hours. </p>
