<h1>Homework</h1>

<p>When doing your homework, I encourage you to use the <a href="../../Misc/ElementsOfStyle.pdf" target="_blank">Elements of Style of Proofs</a> as a reference.  <i>Note:</i>  On each homework assignment, please write (i) your name, (ii) name of course, and (iii) Daily/Weekly Homework number.</p>

<h2>Daily Homework</h2>
<p>The following assignments are to be turned in at the end of the indicated class period.  I reserve the right to modify the assignment if the need arises.  These exercises will form the basis of the student-led presentations each day.  Daily assignments will be graded on a $\checkmark$-system.  Exercises marked with * are eligible for the formal Weekly Homework assignments.  During class, <b> you are only allowed to annotate your homework using the felt-tip pens that I will provide</b>.</p>

<p><i>Note:</i>  On each Daily Homework, please write (i) your name, (ii) name of course, and (iii) Daily Homework number.</p>

<h2>Weekly Homework</h2>
<p>In addition to the Daily Homework, you will also be required to submit two formally written proofs each week.  You may choose any two problems marked with * that were <i>turned in</i> during a given week to submit the following Tuesday by 5PM (occasionally, the due date may be a day other than Tuesday).  For example, you may choose any two problems marked with a * that were turned in during week 2 for the second Weekly Homework assignment.  These problems are due by 5PM on Tuesday in week 3.</p>

<p>Beginning with the second Weekly Homework assignment, you will be required to type your submission.  You should type your Weekly Homework assignments using $\LaTeX$ (see below for on this), MS Word, OpenOffice/LibreOffice, or Google Docs.  However, <b>everyone is required to electronically submit a PDF file</b> using the following naming convention:</p>
<p>
	<center>
		<code>WeeklyXLast-Name.pdf</code>
	</center>
</p>
<p>where you replace "X" with the assignment number and replace "Last-Name" with your actual last name.  Please do <i>not</i> put any spaces in your file name.  If you need help with converting your document to a PDF, please let me know.</p>

<ul>
	<li><b>Weekly Homework 1:</b> Choose any two *-problems from Daily Homework 1-2.  <i>Note:</i> This assignment does not need to be typed.  (Due Tuesday, February 7)</li>
	<li><b>Weekly Homework 2:</b> Choose any two *-problems from Daily Homework 3-4. (Due Tuesday, February 14)</li>
	<li><b>Weekly Homework 3:</b> Choose any two *-problems from Daily Homework 5-6. (Due Tuesday, February 21)</li>
	<li><b>Weekly Homework 4:</b> Choose any two *-problems from Daily Homework 7-9. (Due Tuesday, February 28)</li>
	<li><b>Weekly Homework 5:</b> Choose any two *-problems from Daily Homework 15-17. (Due Thursday, April 5)</li>
	<li><b>Weekly Homework 6:</b> Choose any two *-problems from Daily Homework 18-25. (Due Thursday, April 26)</li>
	<li><b>Weekly Homework 7:</b> Choose any two *-problems from Daily Homework 26-28. (Due Thursday, May 3)</li>
</ul> 

<h2>LaTeX Template for Homework</h2>
<p>You can find a $\LaTeX$ template for typing up your homework in my <a href="http://www.scribtex.com/projects/dcernst/dana-s-shared-scribtex-stuff/" target="_blank">public ScribTeX folder</a>.  In this directory you will also find a help file for using $\LaTeX$ with ScribTeX.  You can download the entire directory and then if you are using ScribTeX, you can upload the files you are interested in using.  Alternatively, you can copy the content of the file and paste it into a new tex file.</p>

<p>For a rough overview of some of the basics of $\LaTeX$, you might find the <a href="../../latex.html" target="_blank">Quick LaTeX Guide</a> useful.</p>

<h2>Getting Help</h2>
<p>There are many resources available to get help.  First, I recommend that you work on homework in groups as much as possible, and to come see me whenever necessary.  Also, you are strongly encouraged to ask questions in the <a href="http://www.plymouth.edu/webapp/courses/course/view.php?id=15979" target="_blank">course forum</a> on our Moodle page page, as I will post comments there for all to benefit from.  To effectively post to the course forum, you will need to learn the basics of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LaTeX" target="_blank">LaTeX</a>, the standard language for typesetting in the mathematics community.  See the <a href="../../latex.html">Quick LaTeX guide</a> for help with $\LaTeX$.  If you need additional help with $\LaTeX$, post a question in the <a href="http://www.plymouth.edu/webapp/courses/course/view.php?id=15979" target="_blank">course forum</a> on our Moodle page.</p>

<p>You can also visit the <a href="http://www.plymouth.edu/math/resources/center.html" target="_blank">Math Activity Center</a>, which is located in Hyde 351.  This student-run organization provides peer tutoring services for most 1000 and 2000 level math courses and some 3000 level courses.  Tutors are typically math majors interested in teaching math and practicing their instructional skills.  You can drop in anytime during open hours. </p>
