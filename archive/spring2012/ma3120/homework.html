<li><b>Weekly Homework 7:</b> Complete the following tasks. (Due Thursday, May 3 by 5PM)
	<ol> 
		<li>Let
			\[A=\begin{bmatrix}1 & -2 & 1 & 1\\ 2 & -4 & -1 & 3\\ 1 & -2 & 0 & 0\\ -2 & 4 & 1 & 0\end{bmatrix}\]

			<ul>
				<li>Find the rank of $A$.</li>
				<li>Find the nullity of $A$.</li>
				<li>Explain the geometric significance of the values for the rank and nullity.</li>
				<li>What is the determinant of $A$?  Based on your previous answers, you should know the answer without having to compute it directly.</li>
			</ul>			
		<li>Let
			\[B=\begin{bmatrix}-2 & 0 & 0\\ 0 & 1 & 0\\ 0 & 0 & 0\end{bmatrix}\]
		Using the above matrix, answer the following questions.
			<ul>
				<li>Find the eigenvalues for $B$.  You should be able to do this very quickly!  But be sure to justify your answer.</li>
				<li>For each eigenvalue, find a basis for the corresponding eigenspace and then describe it geometrically.</li>
				<li>The matrix $B$ determines a function from $\mathbb{R}^3$ to $\mathbb{R}^3$.  Describe this function geometrically.</li>
			</ul>
		</li>
		<li>Let
			\[C=\begin{bmatrix}-1 & 2 & 2\\ 2 & 2 & -1\\ 2 & -1 & 2\end{bmatrix}\]
		Using the above matrix, find the eigenvalues for $C$ and then determine the dimension for each of the corresponding eigenspaces.  Compute the eigenvalues by hand.  You can use Sage or your calculator to help you find the dimensions, but justify your answers.</li>

<h2>Getting Help</h2>
<p>There are many resources available to get help.  First, I recommend that you work on homework in groups as much as possible, and to come see me whenever necessary.  Also, you are strongly encouraged to ask questions in the <a href="http://www.plymouth.edu/webapp/courses/course/view.php?id=15980" target="_blank">course forum</a> on our Moodle page page, as I will post comments there for all to benefit from.  To effectively post to the course forum, you will need to learn the basics of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LaTeX" target="_blank">LaTeX</a>, the standard language for typesetting in the mathematics community.  See the <a href="../../latex.html">Quick LaTeX guide</a> for help with $\LaTeX$.  If you need additional help with $\LaTeX$, post a question in the <a href="http://www.plymouth.edu/webapp/courses/course/view.php?id=15980" target="_blank">course forum</a> on our Moodle page.</p>

<p>You can also visit the <a href="http://www.plymouth.edu/math/resources/center.html" target="_blank">Math Activity Center</a>, which is located in Hyde 351.  This student-run organization provides peer tutoring services for most 1000 and 2000 level math courses and some 3000 level courses.  Tutors are typically math majors interested in teaching math and practicing their instructional skills.  You can drop in anytime during open hours. </p>
