<h1>Homework</h1>

<h2>Daily Homework</h2>

<p>For our Daily Homework, we will be using <a href="http://webassign.net">WebAssign</a>, which is an online homework system.  Each student will need a WebAssign account and when creating your account you will need our WebAssign Class Key: <code>plymouth 1561 1336</code>.  If you need help getting started with WebAssign, I suggest reading the <a href="http://www.webassign.net/manual/WA_Student_Quick_Start.pdf" target="_blank">WebAssign Student Quick Start Guide</a>.  Typically, the Daily Homework will be due on Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays at 5:00PM.</p>

<h2>Weekly Homework</h2>

<p>In addition to the Daily Homework, you will also be required to submit formally written solutions to selected problems each week. Assignments will be added as we go.  If you do not have a book with the exercises in them, you will have to access problems from the book via the eBook.  One way to do this is to click on "My eBook" from within WebAssign and then navigating to the appropriate section.</p>

<h2>Getting Help</h2>
<p>There are many resources available to get help.  First, I recommend that you work on homework in groups as much as possible, and to come see me whenever necessary.  Also, you are strongly encouraged to ask questions in the <a href="http://www.plymouth.edu/webapp/courses/course/view.php?id=16220" target="_blank">course forum</a> on our Moodle page page, as I will post comments there for all to benefit from.  To effectively post to the course forum, you will need to learn the basics of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LaTeX" target="_blank">LaTeX</a>, the standard language for typesetting in the mathematics community.  See the <a href="../../latex.html">Quick LaTeX guide</a> for help with $\LaTeX$.  If you need additional help with $\LaTeX$, post a question in the <a href="http://www.plymouth.edu/webapp/courses/course/view.php?id=16220" target="_blank">course forum</a> on our Moodle page.</p>

<p>You can also visit the <a href="http://www.plymouth.edu/math/resources/center.html" target="_blank">Math Activity Center</a>, which is located in Hyde 351.  This student-run organization provides peer tutoring services for most 1000 and 2000 level math courses and some 3000 level courses.  Tutors are typically math majors interested in teaching math and practicing their instructional skills.  You can drop in anytime during open hours. </p>
