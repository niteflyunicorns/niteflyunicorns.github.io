			<h2>Teaching</h2>
			<p>I hadn't planned on going into mathematics when I started as an undergraduate, but after dabbling in some upper-level math courses I found the subject too beautiful to pass by.  Perhaps because it took me a while to discover the aesthetic of mathematics for myself, one of my favorite parts of my job is being able to share an appreciation of this subject with students &mdash; especially students who have never enjoyed mathematics.</p>
			<p>For research projects I've explored with undergraduates, please see my <a href="research.html">research page.</a></p>

			<dd><div id='math453spring2009' style='display:none'><p>This is a basic introductory course to number theory with a focus on `elementary' methods.  After covering basic topics like divisibility, primality, and the Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic, we'll then introduce modular arithmetic, study basic arithmetic functions and their properties, learn about quadratic reciprocity, and investigate primitive roots for various moduli.  If time permits, we'll also cover some of the current applications of elementary number theory, particularly the RSA cryptosystem. </p>
			<p>This course includes a variety of methodologies to promote active and creative student engagement in the class.  For instance, the primary course management tool is its own Wiki, located at <a href="http://math453spring2009.wikidot.com" target="_blank">http://math453spring2009.wikidot.com</a>.  Throughout the term students are generating and participating in discussions of course content through the Wiki's own forum.  Students will be responsible for preparing their own Wiki pages and in-class presentations on number theoretic topics of their choice; these will occur at the end of the term.</p>
