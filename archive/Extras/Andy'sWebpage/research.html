			<h2>Research</h2>
			<p>As a graduate student my advisor was <a href='http://math.stanford.edu/~vakil' target='_blank'>Ravi Vakil</a>, and my project was to extend some results of Min&aacute;&#269; and Swallow concerning the module structure of certain Galois cohomology groups.  I also considered extensions of these problems to &Eacute;tale cohomology groups, a project I'm still investigating.</p>  <p>I had the privilege to work with <a href='http://www.davidson.edu/math/swallow/' target='_blank'>John Swallow</a> while I was an undergrad at Davidson college, and through John I was introduced to <a href='http://www.math.uwo.ca/~minac/minac.html' target='_blank'>J&aacute;n Min&aacute;&#269;</a> and their Galois module work.  Since then I have worked on several projects which aim to extend their initial results concerning <i>p</i>th power classes of field extensions of degree <i>p</i> to more general settings.</p>
<!--			<p>In the winter of 2006 a handful of algebraic geometry students got together to try to get a feel for some results in &Eacute;tale Cohomology. We set up a rough <a href="w06/etale_cohomology">webpage</a> to chronicle our adventures.</p>
-->
<!--			<center><h2>Current Projects</h2></center>
			In addition to my thesis problem I also have a couple of projects on the side.  Below is a rough sketch of each.
			<dl>
			<dt><a href="papers/MSS2v0512.pdf">Galois module structure of K<sup>*</sup>/K<sup>*p<sup>s</sup></sup></a></dt>
			<dd>Status:  Pretty close (we hope)</dd>
			<dd>Summary: We attempt to decompose higher level power classes for a field extension of degree p<sup>n</sup> over some base.  In the case that the characteristic of K is p, this problem has already been resolved (and generalized!) in "<a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/math.NT/0602546">Galois module structure of Milnor K-theory mod p<sup>s</sup> in characteristic p</a>."</dd>
			<dt><a href="papers/">Galois module structure of k<sub>m</sub>E<sub>n</sub> for [E<sub>n</sub>:E<sub>0</sub>]=p<sup>n</sup></a>
			<dd>Status:  Missing a much needed result</dd>
			<dd>Summary: The title pretty much says it all: this is a project where we attempt to understand the structure of higher Milnor k-theory groups for p-power extensions of fields.  The case in characterstic p is already resolved in "<a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/math.NT/0405503">Galois module structure of Milnor K-theory in characteristic p</a>."

			<h4>Work with Undergraduates</h4>
			<p>I've had the benefit of working with many excellent undergraduate students. Below is a list of research projects I have pursued with some of the most enthusiastic of these students. </p>
			<ul>
<!--			<li><b>James Doran</b> worked on a series of short projects exploring applications of linear algebra.  His projects included an enhanced version of the image processing algorithm introduced in the class that takes advantage of the singular value decomposition, as well as an implementation of a basic version of Google's PageRank algorithm.</li>-->
			<li><p>In the fall of 2009, <b>Jen Berg</b> and I started a project in which we explore generalization to Artin-Schreier theory of some Galois modules (and their implications) related to Kummer theory.</p></li>
			<li>In the fall of 2008, <b>Greg Hurst</b> came to me interested in studying recursive algorithms for computing Bell numbers.  His initial idea turned into the collaborative paper <a href="http://front.math.ucdavis.edu/0906.0696">"An elementary (number theory) proof of Touchard's congruence"</a> which was recently submitted for publication.
