<h1>Homework</h1>

<p>When doing your homework, I encourage you to use the <a href="../../Misc/ElementsOfStyle.pdf" target="_blank">Elements of Style of Proofs</a> as a reference.</p>

<h2>Daily Homework</h2>
<p>The following assignments are to be turned in at the end of the indicated class period.  I reserve the right to modify the assignment if the need arises.  These exercises will form the basis of the student-led presentations each day.  Daily assignments will be graded on a $\checkmark$-system.  Exercises marked with * are eligible for the formal Weekly Write-ups.</p>

<p><i>Note:</i>  On each Daily Homework, please write (i) your name, (ii) name of course, and (iii) Daily Homework number.</p>

<ul>

<h2>Weekly Write-ups</h2>
<p>In addition to the Daily Homework, you will also be required to submit two formally written proofs each week.  By 5PM on Tuesday of week $n$, you should submit the proofs of any two <i>theorems</i> that were <i>turned in</i> for Daily Homework during week $n-1$.  Beginning with the second Weekly Write-up, you will be required to type your submission.  You can either email me your Weekly Write-up as a PDF file, share them with me via PSU Google Docs, or submit a hard copy in person.</p></p>

<p><i>Note:</i>  On each Weekly Write-up, please write (i) your name, (ii) name of course, and (iii) Weekly Write-up number.  You should type your Weekly Write-ups using $\LaTeX$, MS Word, OpenOffice/LibreOffice, or Google Docs.  If you plan to email me your file, then you should send me a PDF (if you need help with this, please let me know).  Furthermore, you should name your file using the following convention:</p>
<p>
<center>
<code>WeeklyXLast-Name.pdf</code>
</center>
</p>
<p>where you replace "X" with the assignment number and replace "Last-Name" with your actual last name.  Please don't put any spaces in your file name.</p>

<ul>
<li><b>Weekly Write-up 1:</b> Choose any two *-problems from Daily Homework 2, 3, 4  (Due Tuesday, September 20 by 5PM). <i>Note:</i> This assignment does not need to be typed.</li>
<li><b>Weekly Write-up 2:</b> Choose any two *-problems from Daily Homework 5, 6, 7  (Due Friday, September 30 by 5PM).  <i>Note:</i> Beginning with this assignment, your weekly write-ups should be typed (using $\LaTeX$, MS Word, Google Docs, etc.).  Regardless of what you use to type up your assignment, if you email me your assignment, please email me a PDF file following the naming convention discussed above.</li>
<li><b>Weekly Write-up 3:</b> Choose any two *-problems from Daily Homework 8 and 9 (Due Tuesday, October 4 by 5PM).
<li><b>Weekly Write-up 4:</b> Choose any two *-problems from Daily Homework 10, 11, 12 (Due Thursday, October 18 by 5PM).
<li><b>Weekly Write-up 5:</b> Choose any two *-problems from Daily Homework 13, 14, 15 (Due Thursday, October 27 by 5PM).
<li><b>Weekly Write-up 6:</b> Choose any two *-problems from Daily Homework 16, 17, 18 (Due Thursday, November 3 by 5PM).
<li><b>Weekly Write-up 7:</b> Choose any two *-problems from Daily Homework 19, 20, 21, 22, 23 (Due Tuesday, November 15 by 5PM).
<li><b>Weekly Write-up 8:</b> Choose any two *-problems from Daily Homework 24, 25, 26, 27, 28 (Due Thursday, December 8 by 5PM).
</ul> 

<h2>LaTeX Template for Homework</h2>
<p>You can find a $\LaTeX$ template for typing up your homework in my <a href="http://www.scribtex.com/projects/dcernst/dana-s-shared-scribtex-stuff/" target="_blank">public ScribTeX folder</a>.  In this directory you will also find a help file for using $\LaTeX$ with ScribTeX.  You can download the entire directory and then if you are using ScribTeX, you can upload the files you are interested in using.  Alternatively, you can copy the content of the file and paste it into a new tex file.</p>

<p>For a rough overview of some of the basics of $\LaTeX$, you might find the <a href="../../latex.html" target="_blank">Quick LaTeX Guide</a> useful.</p>
