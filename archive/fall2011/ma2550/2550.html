<h1>Welcome</h1>
<p>Welcome to the course web page for the Fall 2011 manifestation of MA2550: Calculus I at <a href="http://plymouth.edu">Plymouth State University</a>.</p>

<h2>What is this course all about?</h2>
<p>This course is a first calculus course concentrating on limits, continuity, the derivative and integration. Applications are made to classical problems in physics and other sciences. We will occasionally make use of software packages, like <a href="http://sagemath.org" target="_blank">Sage</a>, which are capable of doing symbolic mathematics.  For more details, see the <a href="syllabus.html">syllabus</a>.</p>

<script type="text/javascript">makeInstructorInfo();</script>

<h2>Textbook</h2>

<p>We will be using <i>Calculus: Early Transcendentals</i>, 7th edition (Thomson/Brooks Cole) by James Stewart.  In addition, we will be using <a href="http://webassign.net" target="_blank">WebAssign</a>, which is an online homework system.  You have four options for purchasing the textbook; each of which comes bundled with WebAssign.  For more information, go <a href="CalculusBookOptions.pdf" target="_blank">here</a>.

<p>I expect you to be <i>reading</i> the textbook.  I will not be covering every detail of the textbook and the only way to achieve a sufficient understanding of the material is to be digesting the reading in a meaningful way.  You should be seeking clarification about the material in the textbook whenever necessary by asking questions in class or posting questions to the course forum.</p>

<h2>Getting Help</h2>

<p>There are many resources available to get help.  First, I recommend that you work on homework in groups as much as possible and to come see me whenever necessary.  Also, you are strongly encouraged to ask questions in the <a href="http://www.plymouth.edu/webapp/courses/course/view.php?id=12737" target="_blank">course forum</a> on our Moodle page, as I will post comments there for all to benefit from.</p>

<p>To effectively post to the course forum, you will need to learn the basics of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LaTeX">LaTeX</a>, the standard language for typesetting in the mathematics community.  See the <a href="../../latex.html">Quick LaTeX guide</a> (coming soon) for help with $\LaTeX$.  If you need additional help with $\LaTeX$, post a question in the <a href="http://www.plymouth.edu/webapp/courses/course/view.php?id=12737" target="_blank">course forum</a> on our Moodle page.</p>

<p>You can also visit the <a href="http://www.plymouth.edu/math/resources/center.html">Math Activity Center</a>, which is located in Hyde 351.  This student-run organization provides peer tutoring services for most 1000 and 2000 level math courses and some 3000 level courses.  Tutors are typically math majors interested in teaching math and practicing their instructional skills.  You can drop in anytime during open hours. </p>
