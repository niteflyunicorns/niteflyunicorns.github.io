EXPECTATIONS<br>
</h2>
<ul style="margin-top: 0in;" type="disc">
  <li class="MsoNormal">The most important thing:&nbsp; DO YOUR
HOMEWORK!!!</li>
  <li class="MsoNormal">Late homework will not be accepted without
prior approval from me.</li>
  <li class="MsoNormal">Each homework assignment will consist of odd
and even numbered problems from the textbook.</li>
  <li class="MsoNormal">Odd numbered problems will be graded for
completeness.</li>
  <li class="MsoNormal">Two of the even numbered problems will be
graded for correctness.</li>
  <li class="MsoNormal">Show all of your work (especially on the evens).</li>
  <li class="MsoNormal">Circle, box, or highlight your final answer.</li>
  <li class="MsoNormal">Be neat and organized (both of us should be
able to read what you wrote).</li>
  <li class="MsoNormal">Put the homework number and section number(s)
somewhere on the first page.</li>
  <li class="MsoNormal">Do the even-numbered problems for each section
on a separate sheet of paper (or at least separate them from the odds).<br>
  </li>
  <li class="MsoNormal">Please do not fold the corners of your
homework.&nbsp; Use a staple!<br>
  </li>
  <li class="MsoNormal">It is your responsibility to check the answers
to the odd-numbered problems.</li>
  <li class="MsoNormal">I recommend doing your homework in pencil (if
you aren&#8217;t making mistakes, then you aren&#8217;t learning).</li>
  <li class="MsoNormal">If homework is not taken seriously, then it
will be very difficult to do well in this class.</li>
  <li class="MsoNormal">Be aware of the fact that an excellent homework
grade can raise your overall class average by a letter grade and that a
poor homework grade can lower your overall class average by a letter
grade.</li>
  <li class="MsoNormal">I am here to help you.&nbsp; If you are having
difficulty with the material and/or your homework, then please ask for
help. &nbsp;I have regular office hours.&nbsp; If these hours don&#8217;t
work for you, then we can schedule a separate time to meet.</li>
  <li class="MsoNormal">Class will usually begin with an opportunity to
ask questions about homework.&nbsp; However,if you have more than a
couple of questions, then we should meet to discuss your questions.<br>
  </li>
  <li class="MsoNormal">You are responsible for writing up and turning
in your own homework, but I recommend doing your homework in groups as
often as you can.</li>
  <li class="MsoNormal">If you need help, then ask!</li>
</ul>
