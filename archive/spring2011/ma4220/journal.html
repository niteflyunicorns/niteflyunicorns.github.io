<h1>Class Journal</h1>

<p>We will keep track of what we cover in class each day through this journal. It won't contain any of the nitty-gritty details of what we have done in a given class, but will instead serve to summarize the key theorems we proved or discussions we had. </p>

<h3>Week 1</h3>
<ul>
<li><b>Tuesday, 2.1.11:</b>  Dana briefly summarized the structure of the course.  We then discussed the natural numbers, integers, and the definition of divides.  We also discussed the basic assumptions that we can make for this course, such as the closure of the integers under addition and multiplication and transitivity of $\leq$.  We finished by proving an example theorem dealing with the definition of divides.</li>
<li><b>Thursday, 2.2.11:</b> We discussed the <a href="../../Misc/ElementsOfStyle.pdf" target="_blank">Elements of Style for Proofs</a> handout and the began our first round of student presentations.  All of the presentations were great, especially given that it was our first go.  AS proved Theorem 1.1, IL proved Theorem 1.2, RC proved Theorem 1.3, and AM proved Theorem 1.6.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Week 2</h3>
<ul>
<li><b>Tuesday, 2.8.11:</b> KH presented a proof of Theorem 1.11, EC proved Theorem 1.12, CQ tackled Theorem 1.14, and CM presented a proof of Theorem 1.15.  After the student presentations, Dana briefly discussed induction and the division algorithm.</li>
<li><b>Thursday, 2.10.11:</b> Great class!  RC nailed 1.17, MW proved 1.18, NT presented a proof of the difficult 1.26, and KH and JC tackled 1.27, which we sorted out collectively.</li>
</ul>


<h3>Week 3</h3>
<ul>
<li><b>Tuesday, 2.15.11:</b> As a class, we quickly discussed 1.29, 1.30, and 1.31.  IL and AM tackled 1.28, each doing one direction of proof.  AS beat out CQ for 1.32 and presented a flawless proof.  KH showed us an impressive sketch of the argument for 1.33, which is the key ingredient to the Euclidean Algorithm, which we discussed as a class.</li>
<li><b>Thursday, 2.17.11:</b> At the beginning of class, Dana briefly discussed Diophantine equations and then we dived into student presentations.  AM and RC computed some gcds using the Euclidean Algorithm for 1.36.  MW reversed engineered the work that AM did to produce a solution to a Diophantine equation.  JC presented the difficult .138, and we finished with BP proving 1.39.  We left 1.40 open.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Week 4</h3>
<ul>
<li><b>Tuesday, 2.22.11:</b> QR, BP, JK, and EC simultaneously wrote up proofs to 1.40, 1.41, 1.42, and 1.43, respectively.  NT presented 1.45.  With the time we had left toward the end of class, Dana attempted to summarize what we've done so far.</li>
<li><b>Thursday, 2.24.11:</b> We started class by eating pizza!  Then Dana continued with summarizing Chapter 1.  RC1 and AC proved each direction of 1.48 and ZG presented 1.51.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Week 5</h3>
<ul>
<li><b>Tuesday, 3.1.11:</b> AS tackled 2.1, RC2 provided an informal proof of 2.7 while CM presented a sketch of a more formal proof, RC1 and CQ attempted 2.8 (but this one remains open), and CM came up a second time and presented 2.9 (which needed some minor adjustments to work).</li>
<li><b>Thursday, 3.3.11:</b> AS presented the forward direction of 2.12 while AM proved the reverse direction.  RC1 provided a sketch for 2.13, CQ/KD presented 2.19, and EC quickly proved 2.21 using 2.19.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Week 6</h3>
<ul>
<li><b>Tuesday, 3.8.11:</b> JC attempted an "iff" proof for 2.26, but we decided that it was more trouble that it was worth.  RC2 presented the contrapositive of the forward direction of 2.26.  BP showed us a flawless proof of 2.27 (Euclid's Lemma).  Both IL and RC1 presented wonderful proofs of 2.32.  KH attempted 2.33, but realized a flaw.  JC came to the board and acted as scribe for an argument that we collectively came up with for 2.33.  We finished by discussing a proof of 2.34, which essentially tells us that there are infinitely many primes.</li>
<li><b>Thursday, 3.3.11:</b> We discussed the assignment for Weekly Write-Up 5, which requires students to peer review two proofs written by students from Wellesley College.  Then Dana discussed a few open problems related to Mersenne and twin primes.  We also discussed the Goldbach Conjecture.  We finished class by allowing students to work on the take-home exam.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Week 7</h3>
<ul>
<li><b>Tuesday, 3.13.11:</b> Dr. Maatta covered class.  IL tackled 2.34 while KH and JC made contributions to 2.46.  RC1 made an attempt on 2.38, but the problem remains open.</li>
<li><b>Thursday, 3.15.11:</b> No class.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Week 8</h3>
<ul>
<li>Spring Break!!!</li>
</ul>

<h3>Week 9</h3>
<ul>
<li><b>Tuesday, 3.29.11:</b> Dana did a little bit of lecturing today.  We discussed the big picture of each of 3.14, 3.15, 3.16, and 3.17.  We also discussed the definition of complete residue system and canonical complete residue system.  In addition, CM presented a proof to 2.38, which is probably the most difficult proof we've encountered so far.</li>
<li><b>Thursday, 3.31.11:</b> RC2 and ZG made short work of 3.18.  RC1 presented one direction of 3.19 and then BP showed us that we could modify this proof to do both directions simultaneously.  Next, CQ presented a beautiful proof of 3.20.  We ended class with a discussion of 3.24.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Week 10</h3>
<ul>
<li><b>Tuesday, 4.5.11:</b> No one was prepared to present 3.28 or 3.29 (Chinese Remainder Theorem), so we sketched a proof of each as a class with Dana and a few other students acting as scribe.</li>
<li><b>Thursday, 4.7.11:</b> ZG and KH discussed two different proofs of 4.2.  AM quickly dispatched 4.3.  CQ presented a proof of 4.4.  RC1 made a good onsight attempt of 4.6, but his approach didn't quite pan out.  Dana jotted down a proof of 4.6 in the last couple minutes of class.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Week 11</h3>
<ul>
<li><b>Tuesday, 4.12.11:</b> As a class, we generated a bunch of examples relative to 4.7 and AM suggested a conjecture.  Dana quickly summarized the main ideas for 4.8, 4.9, and 4.10.  With a little help, RC2 dispatched 4.8.  KH presented a flawless proof of 4.9.  RC1 onsighted both directions of 4.10.</li>
<li><b>Thursday, 4.14.11:</b> One of the best classes of the semester!  AM attacked 4.13 and then JC did some annotating.  NT presented a proof of 4.14.  JC then proved 4.15.  RC1 crushed 4.18.  We finished class with Dana showing how to do the computations in 4.22 without a calculator.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Week 12</h3>
<ul>
<li><b>Tuesday, 4.19.11:</b> IL, ZG, MW, and AC each presented a part of 4.27.  Next, JC presented 4.31.  After that, EC came to the board and attempted to prove 4.32 (Euler's Theorem).  The second half of EC's proof was perfect.  As a class, we discussed how to sort out the first half.  On the way out the door, BP explained how to do the first exercise in 4.34.</li>
<li><b>Thursday, 4.21.11:</b> We spent the entire class session working on the take-home exam.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Week 13</h3>
<ul>
<li><b>Tuesday, 4.26.11:</b> Dana lectured on the remaining material in Chapter 4 and we ate pizza!</li>
<li><b>Thursday, 4.28.11:</b> We spent the entire class period discussing our next batch of peer reviews.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Week 13</h3>
<ul>
<li><b>Tuesday, 5.3.11:</b> Dana lectured on the beginning of the material on cryptography in Chapter 5.</li>
<li><b>Thursday, 5.5.11:</b> Dana summarized the details of RSA, did some examples, and showed how one could use <a href="http://prep.sagenb.org" target="_blank">Sage</a> to do the necessary computations.  After that, MW presented one case for 5.2 and KH quickly showed us the remaining case at the end of class.  JK and AC also presented 5.3 and 5.4, respectively.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Week 15</h3>
<ul>
<li><b>Tuesday, 5.10.11:</b> AS translated my encrypted message (Chewbacca is a wookie) using Sage, CQ discussed a solution to 5.7, and BP explained 5.8 to us from his seat.  We finished class by completing course evaluations.</li>
<li><b>Thursday, 5.12.11:</b>Our last day.  It has been a great semester!  Dana explained the error he made initially when describing how to find $D$ given $p$, $q$, and $E$ for RSA.  We also discussed the latest round of peer reviews.  We finished up with AC presenting problem 7 from Exam 2, BP showing us some RSA stuff he coded up in Sage, and NT proved Theorem 1 from Exam 2.</li>
</ul>
