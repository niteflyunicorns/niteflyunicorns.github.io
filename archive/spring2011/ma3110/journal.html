<h1>Class Journal</h1>

<p>We will keep track of what we cover in class each day through this journal. It won't contain any of the nitty-gritty details of what we have done in a given class, but will instead serve to summarize the key theorems we proved or discussions we had. </p>

<h3>Week 1</h3>
<ul>
<li><b>Monday, 1.31.11:</b> Dana briefly summarized the structure of the course.  We plan to discuss the course in more detail on Wednesday.  We discussed the meaning of <i>theorem</i> and <i>proof</i>; many interesting points were made by various students.  Dana discussed Definitions 1.1 and 1.2, which introduce <i>even</i> and <i>odd</i>, respectively.  With Dana as scribe, the class produced a proof of Theorem 1.3.  AS bravely volunteered to present Theorem 1.4 on the spot.  AS did an excellent job, but we ran out of time and the last line needed some fixing.  Great first go!</li>
<li><b>Wednesday, 2.2.11:</b> No class...snow day!</li>
<li><b>Friday, 2.4.11:</b> Excellent first day of presentations!  After briefly discussing the syllabus, we jumped right into student presentations.  PC was first up and dispensed with Theorem 1.5.  Next, CQ provided a counterexample to 1.6.  Right before the end of class, JD quickly jotted down a proof of Theorem 1.7.  Great discussions on all the problems.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Week 2</h3>
<ul>
<li><b>Monday, 2.7.11:</b> We began by taking a quick look at the first couple items on the <a href="../../Misc/ElementsOfStyle.pdf" target="_blank">Elements of Style of Proofs</a> handout.  Next, we briefly discussed the difference between "$n$ divides $m$" and "$\frac{m}{n}$".  We then jumped right into student presentations.  ZG made short work of Theorem 1.10.  MS quickly dispensed with Theorem 1.11.  AW and RC2 simultaneously wrote up solutions to Problem 1.14 and Theorem 1.15, respectively.  Each presentation provided the backdrop for great class discussions.</li>
<li><b>Wednesday, 2.9.11:</b> As a class, we discussed 1.17, 1.21, and 1.25.  RC1 and BC came to the board and hammered out a couple truth tables for 1.23.  We left 1.24, 1.28, and 1.29 to discuss on Friday.</li>
<li><b>Friday, 2.11.11:</b> We had students simultaneiously write-up solutions on the board to 1.24, 1.28, 1.29, 1.32, 1.33, 1.34, and 1.35.  The following students wrote-up solutions: PC, AD, PH, SJ, JL, AO, IR, and AS.  With the time we had left, students worked in small groups on the next couple problems in the course notes.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Week 3</h3>
<ul>
<li><b>Monday, 2.14.11:</b> Another good class.  AS presented 1.36, SJ provided a counterexample for 1.37, PW put 1.38 on the board, and RC2 and CQ presented proof by contrapostion for 1.40 and 1.41, respectively.</li>
<li><b>Wednesday, 2.16.11:</b> No class (Winter Carnival).</li>
<li><b>Friday, 2.18.11:</b> CQ presented 1.43.  RC1 proved 1.45 and RC2 provided an alternate and shorter proof.  TB showed us 1.49 and SB went above and beyond the call of duty on 1.50.  As a class, we discussed 1.44, 1.46, and 1.47.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Week 4</h3>
<ul>
<li><b>Monday, 2.21.11:</b> Dana did a quick summary of (i) direct proof, (ii) proof via the contrapositive, and (iii) proof by contradiction for propositions of the form $A\implies B$.  AO proved 1.52 via the contrapositive while RC2 tacked the same theorem via a proof by contradiction.  AW presented 1.53 and used a proof by contradiction.</li>
<li><b>Wednesday, 2.23.11:</b> Dana reviewed the basic concepts of free variables, predicates, and quantification.  As a group, we discussed most of the exercises.  We also had NG, MS, and BC present 1.62, 1.63, and 1.65, respectively.</li>
<li><b>Friday, 2.25.11:</b> Due to the weather and closing of campus, we treated class as an optional review session.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Week 5</h3>
<ul>
<li><b>Monday, 2.28.11:</b> We had people put up solutions to all the problems at once.  MS, TV, PC, ZG, and AW wrote up solutions to 1.68, 1.71, 1.74, 1.75, and 1.76, respectively.  NG and RC2 each presented half of 1.78.</li>
<li><b>Wednesday, 3.2.11:</b> As a class, we discussed 1.88, 1.89, and 1.90.  CQ and RC1 each tackled half of 1.85 and BP and SJ each presented parts of 1.92.</li>

AD explained how to do 3.20, ZG presented 3.22, and then BC talked us through 3.26.  We finished class by having AW, AJ, RC1, and RC2 explain the answers to 3.27 (each did two parts). </li>
</ul>

<h3>Week 13</h3>
<ul>
