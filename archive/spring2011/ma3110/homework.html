<h2>Weekly Write-ups</h2>

You may choose any two problems marked with * that were <i>turned in</i> during a given week to submit the following Tuesday by 5PM (occasionally, the due date may be a day other than Tuesday).  For example, you may choose any two problems marked with a * that were turned in during week 2 for the second Weekly Write-up.  These problems are due by 5PM on Tuesday in week 3.  Beginning with the second Weekly Write-up, you will be required to type your submission.</p>

<p><i>Note:</i>  On each Weekly Write-up, please write (i) your name, (ii) name of course, and (iii) Weekly Write-up number.

If you plan to email me your file, then you should send me a PDF (if you need help with this, please let me know).  Furthermore, you should name your file using the following convention:</p>
<p>
<center>
<code>WeeklyXLast-Name.pdf</code>

</p>
<p>where you replace "X" with the assignment number and replace "Last-Name" with your actual last name.  Please don't put any spaces in your file name.</p>

<h2>LaTeX Template for Homework</h2>
<p>You can find a $\LaTeX$ template for typing up your homework in my <a href="http://www.scribtex.com/projects/dcernst/dana-s-shared-scribtex-stuff/" target="_blank">public ScribTeX folder</a>.  In this directory you will also find a help file for using $\LaTeX$ with ScribTeX.  You can download the entire directory and then if you are using ScribTeX, you can upload the files you are interested in using.  Alternatively, you can copy the content of the file and paste it into a new tex file.</p>

<p>For a rough overview of some of the basics of $\LaTeX$, you might find the <a href="../../latex.html" target="_blank">Quick LaTeX Guide</a> useful.</p>
