TODO:
- link "view project" button to draugrs project page when its ready
- get better quality logo ?
- remove themify-icons stuff
- find/make new icon set for website
- modify typing animation to slide down (and maybe interact with) the body text explainging who I am on the about page
- get TXG jpg with white background to replace transparent TXG png
- get cover image for countdown (or figure out how to put the video as the cover)



CURRENT BUGS:
- the navbar on the about page has a weird glitch in the active highlighting
- the navbar on the about page fades out nicely but does not fade back in nicely
